## Proof of Judgment

(1) [The Case of the Late Goods.](https://twitter.com/lex_DAO/status/1340328591129796608?s=20) (CONTRACT INTEPRETATION BY LEXDAO COOP PANEL)

## Background

LexDAO is a group of legal / engineering professionals building business / dispute resolution protocols on Ethereum contracts.

Recently, we deployed a [Moloch DAO v2x contract (MYSTIC)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7938a822dFab3Fc318f5ECfC3C986089fa89f319#code) to organize our Coop. membership, as well as a more specialized [sub-DAO (CORPS)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x01b92e2c0d06325089c6fd53c98a214f5c75b2ac#code) to provide more public-facing services after incubation. In addition to giving LexDAO rostering and banking utility, MYSTIC allow us to resolve disputed Ethereum contract states and issue on-chain opinions through an incorporated form of the Raid Guild *[Minion](https://https://github.com/raid-guild/moloch-minion)* contract. 

To demonstrate an entirely on-chain arbitration protocol among our membership and community beta testers, [LexLocker.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd476595aa1737f5fdbfe9c8fea17737679d9f89a#code) is a smart contract developed and maintained in the LexDAO legal engineering library ([LexCorpus](https://github.com/lexDAO/LexCorpus)) that provides a range of blockchain business logic, such as timelocking and conditional milestone payments.

## 3-Track ADR Offering

To begin, LexDAO offers three levels of arbitration, focusing on EVM users: 

**I> Lo-stakes Slower-speed - PANEL:** *LexDAO Coop.* (42 members, 1:1 votes). This is a non-profit group building legal engineering common goods, such as promoting coding for lawyers / legal for coders. As an association using the Moloch DAO framework, only accounts sponsored and voted on by members can join. Seeded as "good judgment machine."

**II> Hi-stakes Slower-speed - PANEL:** *LexDAO Corps.* (10 members, 1:1 votes, certified LexDAO legal engineers) This profit-focused venture is seeded with LexDAO legal engineers.

**III> Hi-stakes Hi-speed - INDIVIDUAL:** *LexDAO Corps - Swift Resolver Protocol* Individual LexDAO legal engineers selected as `resolver` individually by users by tracking Corps. token holders, or acting separetely to `resolve` LexLocker.eth through token-permissioned `swiftResolver` protocol.

## Protocol

Issues can be submitted to the LexDAO Cooperative via <email><lexdaocoop@gmail.com>. Recommend solutions from our network will be provided, and if the case involves LexLocker.eth, the chosen LexDAO solution (PANEL, INDIVIDUAL) will be coordinated.
