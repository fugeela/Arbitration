## Background

LexDAO is a group of legal / engineering professionals building business / dispute resolution protocols on Ethereum contracts.

Recently, we deployed a [Moloch DAO v2x contract (MYSTIC)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x057e820d740d5aaaffa3c6de08c5c98d990db00d#code) to organize our membership. In addition to providing rostering and banking utility, MYSTIC allow us to resolve disputed Ethereum contract states and issue on-chain opinions through an incorporated form of the Raid Guild *[Minion](https://https://github.com/raid-guild/moloch-minion)* contract. 

In this format, anyone can use LexDAO arbitration directly by assigning resolution control over a deal contract to our MYSTIC (such as a [LexLocker escrow](https://github.com/lexDAO/LexLocker)), allowing instant financial awards, or by requesting a judgment opinion to be submitted to a conventional court (*e.g.*, where dispute is settled in fiat, but not fiat tokens...).

## Two-Track ADR Offering

To begin, we might offer two levels of LexDAO arbitration to the general public, focusing on EVM users: 

**I> Lo-stakes Tier:** *[LexDAO Coop.](https://github.com/lexDAO/Cooperative) MYSTIC* (43 members, 1:1 votes, including non-lawyers, anons). This is a non-profit group building legal engineering common goods, such as promoting coding for lawyers / legal for coders. In this lane, establishing case history ASAP would be a net-good, even if merely mock opinions to demonstrate offering. LexDAO Coop. should therefore deploy competitive, low-rated ADR, to begin, as well as explore being an oracle layer on prediction markets, like Omen.eth, as well as other low-key stuff, like maintaining onchain registries (*e.g.*, updating LexList for Ethereum Contracts & qualifing lawyers to service LexAIR for accredited investors by issuing LXLAW token). 

**II> Hi-stakes Tier:** *LexDAO LLC, ADR Series MYSTIC* (15 members, 1:1 votes, certified LexDAO legal engineers & apprentices) This profit-focused venture should start with our vetted legal engineers targeting higher-stakes disputes such as large $$ grant, service agreements; sell ADR services through a Series of LexDAO LLC for brand, liability purposes.
